# Agile Methodology - Scrum Framework

### What Is Agile Methodology?

Agile methodology is a practice that helps `continuous iteration` of development and testing in the SDLC process. Agile `breaks the product` into `smaller builds`.

In this methodology, development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike other software development methodologies. It also encourages teamwork and `face-to-face communication`. `Business`, `stakeholders`, and `developers` and `clients` must work together to develop a product.

### What Is Scrum?

**Scrum** - is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time. It rapidly and repeatedly inspects actual working software. It emphasizes accountability, teamwork, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.

The `Scrum Framework` usually deals with the fact that the requirements are likely to change or most of the time not known at the start of the project.

### Important Artifacts about scrum framework

**User stories** - A user story is a tool used in `Agile software development` to `capture a description of a software feature` from an end-user perspective. The user story `describes the type of user`, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

A user story template often uses the following type of format:

```
As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>.
```
e.g:

	1. As a user, I want to upload photos so that I can share photos with others.
	2. As an administrator, I want to approve photos before they are posted so that I can make sure they are appropriate.


**Product Owner** - The `Scrum product owner` is typically a `project's key stakeholder`. Part of the product owner responsibilities is to `have a vision of what he or she wishes to build`, and `convey that vision to the scrum team`. This is key to successfully starting any agile software development project. The agile product owner does this in part through the product backlog, which is a prioritized features list for the product.

The product owner - `is commonly a lead user of the system or someone from marketing, product management or anyone with a solid understanding of users, the market place`, the competition and of future trends for the domain or type of system being developed. 


**The Development Team** - It composed by 
	
- Project manager 
- Quality Assurance Team 
- Graphics Designer Team 
- Frontend Team 
- Backend Team 
- Code Auditors 
- System Adminstrators 

**Scrum Master** - The scrum master(Team Leader) is the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.

The responsibilities of this role include:

- Clearing obstacles
- Establishing an environment where the team can be effective
- Addressing team dynamics
- Ensuring a good relationship between the team and product owner as well as others outside the team
- Protecting the team from outside interruptions and distractions.
- The scrum master role was created as part of the Scrum framework.  The name was initially intended to indicate someone who is an expert at Scrum and can therefore coach others.

The role does not generally have any actual authority. People filling this role have to lead from a position of influence, often taking a servant-leadership stance.


**Product Backlog** - is simply a `list of all things that needs to be done within the project`. It replaces the traditional requirements specification artifacts. These items can have a technical nature or can be user-centric e.g. in the form of `user stories`

**Sprint Goal** -  is an objective set for the sprint that `can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog`.

example of sprint goal for a `shopping cart`.

- Implement basic shopping cart functionality including add, remove, and update quantities.
- Develop the checkout process: pay for an order, pick shipping, order gift wrapping, etc.

**Sprint Backlog** - The sprint backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the Scrum sprint. During the sprint planning meeting, the team selects some number of `product backlog items`.

Those selected items from sprint will sort from:

- `Highest` priority. 
- `Low` priority.

**Daily Scrum Meeting** - Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work.

every `sprint task` will be `estimated` and will categorized as:

- New
- Inprogress
- Solved
- Next task

including a `rough estimation` and `percentage` for `every inprogress` task given.

**Project estimations and timeline**

**Sprint Review** - The sprint review is an `informal meeting`, the team gives a demo on the product and will determine what are finished and what arenâ€™t

Attendes in sprint review:
- scrum master 
- product owner
- stakeholders

To determine the:
- finished
- not
